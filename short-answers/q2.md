# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

You could achieve the exact same functionality as the break statement by simply ending the loop earlier when `i < 8`. You could also use `continue` instead of break;
