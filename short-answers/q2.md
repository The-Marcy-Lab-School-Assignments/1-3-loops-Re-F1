# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
End the loop earlier

# Teacher Feedback
You could achieve the exact same functionality as the break; statement by simply ending the loop earlier in it's declaration like so for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {} OR you could use continue; instead
